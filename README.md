# Lucid Automation with Groovy

The goal of this repository is to provide a focused Groovy-based automated checking solution. I'm using Geb, and Spock as my libraries.

Right now this repository is very much in an early state and is simply being used by me for learning purposes. I have some portions that would be considered pure unit tests, executing against Java code, as well as portions that run against my [Decohere Heroku app](https://decohere.herokuapp.com/).

You can run this with:

    gradle clean test
